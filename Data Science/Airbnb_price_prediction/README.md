# Price Prediction for Madrid â€“ Airbnb listings!

As a travel enthusiast, I loved to go to different places. The biggest hurdles to travel is to find budget friendly travel and accommodation. Airbnb for
accommodation has been insanely helpful to my travel endeavours. But I always wondered that the prices for several listings were extremely inconsistent 
with others. I wanted to check on real data from Airbnb and see I can make a prediction model to detect the price discrepancies. I got the data of listings in Madrid city from [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/). Inside Airbnb works towards understanding, deciding and controling the role of renting residential homes to tourists. 
The data used for the project is "Detailed Listings data" for Madrid in [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/).
