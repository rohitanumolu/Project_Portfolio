# EDA on Fossil-Fuel CO2 Emissions

This EDA was performed as a final project for my Data Visualization course at Georgia State University. 
The data comes from [Appalachian Energy Center](https://energy.appstate.edu/cdiac-appstate/data-products) which supports development 
of clean energy technologies. You can find the dataset [here](https://energy.appstate.edu/sites/default/files/nation.1751_2019.xlsx).

The Choropleth maps are unable to be visualized as github static-ally renders notebooks and therefore doesn't embed HTML/JavaScript which helps 
us make plotly graphs like Choropleth. If you want to see the notebook with the graphs you can go to [NBViewer](https://nbviewer.org/) and copy the link to my notebook in the open field. You can copy the link from here
